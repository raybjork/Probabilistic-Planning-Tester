# Probabilistic Planning Tester

This MATLAB project was created to test the effiency of the RRT* family of planners which represent a conceptually simple answer to the problem of robot planning.  Instead of evaluating the robotâ€™s interactions in 3D space we can consider planning in the free configuration space which will be discovered through random sampling.  This project is a test platform wherein several variations of RRT* can be evaluated against each other on maps created by the user.  The algorithms implemented in this repository include:

  - RRT*
  - RRT*-Smart
  - Informed RRT*
  - {a custom variation of RRT*}
  
For each algorithm, various maps can be tested and an animation of the algorithm in action can be viewed as shown below

This project represents independent research I conducted as part of the course "MEAM 520 - Intro to Robotics" at UPenn.  Read the summary of the findings of this research in [this paper](https://github.com/raybjork/Probabilistic-Planning-Tester/blob/master/MEAM_520_Final_Project.pdf)
